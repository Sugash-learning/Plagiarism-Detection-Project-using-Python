Collaboration means that people in a group are putting their brains together to get the job done. A collaborative group donâ€™t work as individuals on separate tasks only to come together at the end. Instead, the group work in unison on tasks.

By working collaboratively rather than as individuals within a group, people can share ideas and thoughts, allowing you to create a better product than you would have on your own.
