Not all delegation is good. A team leader who delegates tasks to team members who lack the skills or training for the task may be doing a disservice to the team.

But good delegation is inherent in a good team.

Good delegation may involve extensive consultation, knowing each team memberâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, and even negotiation to ensure all team members are happy with the delegated tasks and group roles.
